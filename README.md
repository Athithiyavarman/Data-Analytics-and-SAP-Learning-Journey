# Data Analytics & SAP Learning Journey – 100 Days

Welcome to my 100-day journey of upskilling in Data Analytics and SAP Functional Consulting (S/4HANA).  
This repository contains hands-on practice, project work, and documentation across key tools and technologies used by analysts and ERP consultants.

## Objective

To become placement-ready by building real-world skills in:

- Excel for data tracking and reporting
- SQL for database querying and data manipulation
- Python for logic building and automation
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboards
- SAP S/4HANA (SD Module & Navigation) for ERP system understanding
- Aptitude preparation for placement assessments

## Repository Structure

## Tools and Technologies

- Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Charts, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting)
- MySQL and SQL-based platforms (W3Schools, Hackerrank)

## Progress Tracking

Learning progress is logged daily in Notion.  
GitHub is used to store final files and deliverables by skill/topic — not raw day-wise tracking.
